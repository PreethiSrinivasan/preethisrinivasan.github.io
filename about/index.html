<h2> Key to success- Hardwork and Right Time!</h2>
<p> </p>

<p>I was born in Erode, a city in TamilNadu, India well known for garments and turmeric exports. I was raised in Mysore, the city of palaces and temples. Mysore is nothing but a heaven for me! Alongside with my Education,I started learning Carnatic Music, I developed a particular interest in this field and I soon completed my Junior and Senior Grade Music Exam.</p>
