	<p>Quoting my advisor <a href="#"> Prof Jerry Zeyu Gao </a>, this field explores theories on detecting the graffiti crimes accross the city of San Jose. Trying to detect specific patterns are very challenging. So focusing algorithm to construct a Modus Operandi for finding the clues of the offender's psycology.Bayes' theorem is also an effective way in predicting the graffiti scenes. It gives the conditional probaibilty based on the previous observations using data driven approaches.    </p>
