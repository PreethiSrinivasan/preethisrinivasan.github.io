	<p>Quoting my advisor <a href="http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/gaojerry/"> Prof Jerry Zeyu Gao </a>, this field explores theories on detecting the graffiti crimes accross the city of San Jose. Trying to detect specific patterns are very challenging. So focusing algorithm to construct a Modus Operandi for finding the clues of the offender's psycology.Bayes' theorem is also an effective way in predicting the graffiti scenes. It gives the conditional probaibilty based on the previous observations using data driven approaches.    </p>

	<h3> A/B Split Testing</h3>
	<a href="#"></a>
	<p> A/B testing Tool compares two versions of a webpage or an app against each other to determine which performs better. A/B testing is the great method for determining the best online marketing strategies for your business. A/B split testing is a method of statistical hypothesis testing which contains two variants and determines which variant performs better.I have worked on the Significance Analysis in the context of Conversion Rates method which determines which variant is better. Even so, I aim to build a even more effective solution using Significance Analysis in the context of analysing p-value. </p>
